#Objective:
    #The aim of this assignment is to build a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The

#Task 1:
    #Create functions for each arithmetic operation, with parameters for two numbers to be used in the operation

#Task 2:
    #Implement user input to receive numbers and an operation choice, their response for operation should call the associated function
        
#Task 3:
    #Ensure your program can handle division by zero and other potential errors.

#2. The Shopping List Maker Objective: The aim of this assignment is to create a program that helps users make a shopping list

    #Task 1: Write a function that lets the user add items to a list, make sure you ask the user what they would like to add (reminder: ensure the function has a parameter to receive the list).

    #Task 2: Include a feature to remove items from the list.

    #Task 3: Add a function that prints out the entire list.




# Task 1: Write a function to add items to a list
